# Image Processing
Image processing is a field of study that involves the manipulation of images to enhance their quality, extract useful information, or facilitate subsequent analysis. It encompasses a wide range of techniques and algorithms aimed at modifying or analyzing images in various domains, including photography, medical imaging, satellite imagery, and more

### Image Acquisition: 
The process of obtaining digital images from various sources such as cameras, scanners, satellites, or medical imaging devices.

### Image Enhancement: 
Techniques to improve the visual quality of images by adjusting brightness, contrast, sharpness, and reducing noise. Common methods include histogram equalization, contrast stretching, and noise filtering.

### Image Restoration: 
Restoring degraded images by removing artifacts, blurs, or distortions introduced during acquisition or transmission. Deconvolution and image inpainting are common restoration techniques.

### Image Compression: 
Reducing the storage size of images while minimizing loss of visual quality. Compression methods include lossy (e.g., JPEG) and lossless (e.g., PNG) compression algorithms.

### Feature Extraction: 
Identifying and extracting meaningful features or patterns from images, such as edges, corners, textures, or objects. Techniques like edge detection, corner detection, and texture analysis are used for feature extraction.

### Image Segmentation: 
Dividing an image into multiple regions or segments based on similarities in color, intensity, texture, or other properties. Segmentation is often a crucial step in object detection, recognition, and analysis tasks.

### Object Detection and Recognition: 
Identifying and classifying objects or regions of interest within an image. Techniques range from traditional methods like template matching to modern deep learning approaches such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

### Image Registration: 
Aligning multiple images of the same scene or object to facilitate comparison or fusion. Registration is essential in applications like medical image analysis, remote sensing, and panoramic image stitching.

### Morphological Image Processing: 
Analyzing and manipulating image shapes and structures using morphological operations such as dilation, erosion, opening, and closing. These operations are useful for tasks like noise removal, object detection, and image segmentation.

### Geometric Image Transformation: 
Modifying the spatial arrangement of pixels in an image through operations like rotation, scaling, translation, and affine transformations. These transformations are applied for image rectification, alignment, or geometric correction.

### Color Image Processing: 
Manipulating color images by adjusting color balance, saturation, hue, or performing color space conversions. Color processing is essential in fields like photography, digital art, and medical imaging.
